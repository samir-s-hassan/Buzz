# Buzz

Buzz is an app that mimics Reddit and works much like any other social media app. Users can create profiles and edit their profiles with basic information such as Name, Gender, Sexual Orientation, Bio. Users can also view other people's profiles on this platform but some information is hidden. Buzz allows people to post, upvote, downvote, comment, and interact with posts. Buzz also has login functionality that takes advantage of Google OAuth to load everything for that user.

## Notes

This app was NOT solely created by me; This app was made in collaboration with others. Although this repo holds the source code, version control was not done within this repo. We used Bitbucket instead.
